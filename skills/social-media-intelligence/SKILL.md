# Social Media Intelligence

Systematic approaches for investigating social media: authenticating accounts, detecting coordinated behavior, and tracking how narratives spread.

> **Adapted from** [jamditis/claude-skills-journalism](https://github.com/jamditis/claude-skills-journalism) by Jay Amditis (MIT License). Extended for integration with the OSINT investigation pipeline.

Before running any social-media scraper or CLI with keywords, handles, URLs, dates, or output paths, invoke `shell-safety`. Do not interpolate search text into shell commands; pass it through JSON, stdin, a temp file, or a helper that uses argv safely.

## When to Use This Skill

- Investigating whether an account is authentic or artificially amplified
- Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior across a set of accounts
- Tracking how a claim or story has spread across platforms
- Mapping relationships between accounts pushing a narrative
- Building timestamped evidence trails from social content before it disappears
- Monitoring breaking news across social platforms

## Account Authenticity Assessment

Before trusting a social media account as a source, assess its authenticity. Work through these red flags systematically.

### Account-level signals

| Signal | Red flag threshold | How to check |
|---|---|---|
| Account age | Created < 30 days ago | Profile creation date |
| Follower/following ratio | Ratio < 0.1 (follows 10x more than follows back) | Profile stats |
| Posting volume | > 50 posts/day sustained | Post count ÷ account age |
| Profile photo | Generic, stock-looking, or AI-generated | Reverse image search (TinEye, Google Lens) |
| Bio content | Keyword-stuffed, no personal details, copied text | Read and search bio phrases |
| Personal content ratio | Mostly reshares, < 10% original content | Scroll recent posts |
| Engagement rate | Unusually high (> 20%) or unusually low (< 0.1%) | Likes + comments ÷ followers |

### Authenticity score

Tally red flags. Three or more warrants explicit `low` confidence on any finding sourced from this account.

Document in `confidence_rationale`: "Account shows [N] authenticity red flags: [list them]."

## Coordination Detection

Coordinated inauthentic behavior is when multiple accounts act together to artificially amplify content. Check these signals when you see multiple accounts pushing the same narrative.

### Timing patterns

- [ ] Multiple accounts posting identical or near-identical content within minutes of each other
- [ ] Synchronized posting times across accounts with no obvious reason (different time zones, no event trigger)
- [ ] Burst activity (sudden spike) followed by complete dormancy
- [ ] Post timestamps suggest automated scheduling (uniform intervals, round-number minutes)

### Content patterns

- [ ] Identical or near-identical text across multiple accounts
- [ ] Same images or media shared by unrelated accounts in rapid succession
- [ ] Identical typos, formatting errors, or unusual punctuation preserved across accounts
- [ ] Copy-paste artifacts visible (e.g., formatting marks, extra spaces)

### Account patterns

- [ ] Multiple accounts created around the same time (same week or month)
- [ ] Similar username conventions (name + random numbers, generic word + numbers)
- [ ] Generic, stock, or AI-generated profile photos across multiple accounts
- [ ] All accounts follow the same narrow set of other accounts
- [ ] Accounts engage with each other disproportionately relative to their follower base

### Network patterns

- [ ] Accounts form dense clusters — they primarily interact with each other, not the broader conversation
- [ ] All amplify the same external sources or domains
- [ ] Target the same accounts for replies or mentions
- [ ] Coordination visible across platforms (same content appears on X, Facebook, Telegram simultaneously)

### Scoring

**0–1 signals:** Normal variation. Note and move on.
**2–3 signals:** Flag for further investigation. Do not cite these accounts as independent sources.
**4+ signals:** Strong coordination indicator. Treat as a single source, not multiple. Document all signals explicitly in the investigation log.

## Narrative Tracking

When investigating how a claim spread, reconstruct the propagation chain.

### Step 1: Find the origin

Search for the earliest known instance of the claim or content:

- Wayback Machine CDX API: validate `{URL}` with `scripts/spotlight_safe.py`, then use `curl --get ... --data-urlencode "url={URL}" --data-urlencode "output=json" --data-urlencode "limit=3" --data-urlencode "fl=timestamp,original"`
- `search("<claim keywords>", output_path, limit=20)` with date filters — restrict to the window before the story went viral
- Check if the claim appears in fringe or low-credibility sources before mainstream ones — a common sign of coordinated seeding

### Step 2: Map the spread

For each major appearance of the claim, record:

```json
{
  "appearance_id": "A1",
  "platform": "X|Facebook|Telegram|etc",
  "author": "account handle",
  "url": "post URL",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
  "archive_url": "Wayback or Archive.today URL",
  "engagement": { "likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0 },
  "source_of_claim": "original|reshare|paraphrase"
}
```

### Step 3: Identify amplifiers

Who has the largest reach in the spread? Are they:

- Verified accounts (harder to be inauthentic)
- Known political or ideological actors
- Media organizations that picked it up without verification
- Accounts that exclusively amplify one type of content

### Step 4: Note velocity

Fast spread (viral in hours) vs. slow build (days/weeks) tells you different things. Slow, coordinated spread from low-credibility accounts seeding to high-credibility ones is a classic astroturfing pattern.

## Platform Tools

| Platform | Best approach | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | Advanced search, Apify X scraper | API severely restricted; Apify actor bypasses this for public data |
| Facebook | CrowdTangle (academic) or Apify | Direct API effectively closed; pages and public groups accessible |
| Instagram | Apify Instagram scraper | No public search API; stories disappear in 24h — archive immediately |
| TikTok | Exolyt, Pentos, Apify TikTok scraper | Limited historical data |
| Reddit | Pushshift (partial), Arctic Shift | Historical data access varies |
| YouTube | YouTube Data API v3 | Good metadata; search `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in env |
| Bluesky | AT Protocol Firehose | Open, real-time, no auth required for public data |
| Telegram | TGStat, Telemetrio, Telepathy | Public channels searchable; private groups inaccessible |

### Pluggable platform scraping

Platform-specific scraping can be configured via the `PLATFORM_SCRAPER` env var. Two common backings:

**Option A — Apify (hosted platform scrapers):**

If `APIFY_TOKEN` is set, use Apify actors:

```
write-file("cases/{project}/research/apify-twitter-input.json", <serialized actor input JSON>)
execute-shell('apify call apify/twitter-scraper --input-file cases/{project}/research/apify-twitter-input.json')
write-file("cases/{project}/research/apify-instagram-input.json", <serialized actor input JSON>)
execute-shell('apify call apify/instagram-scraper --input-file cases/{project}/research/apify-instagram-input.json')
write-file("cases/{project}/research/apify-tiktok-input.json", <serialized actor input JSON>)
execute-shell('apify call apify/tiktok-scraper --input-file cases/{project}/research/apify-tiktok-input.json')
```

If the installed Apify CLI does not support `--input-file`, use a local wrapper that reads JSON from a file and passes it through argv/subprocess without invoking a shell. Do not inline search terms or direct URLs into a shell command.

**Option B — Native platform APIs:**

When the platform offers a direct API (YouTube Data API v3, Bluesky AT Protocol, Telegram TGStat), prefer it. Document which backing was used in `access_notes` on each source entry.

**Option C — Manual archive + scrape:**

If no scraper is configured, use `fetch(profile_url, ...)` + manual review. Lower throughput but no auth dependency.

## Evidence Preservation

Social content disappears. Archive before you cite.

Archive every post that supports a finding using `invoke-skill("web-archiving")`. For social media specifically:

- Screenshots are supplementary, not primary — archive the URL
- Archive the account profile page, not just the individual post
- For Instagram Stories and TikToks: download video/image immediately; these expire
- Record engagement counts at time of access — they change

---

## Ethical Guidelines

- Archive and analyze **public** content only
- Do not create fake accounts to monitor private groups or gain access
- Respect platform terms of service — ToS-violating data collection can sink a story legally
- Protect sources who share private social content with you
- Verify coordination before publishing — false accusations of astroturfing are defamatory
- Consider whether publishing account analysis might put individuals at risk

---

## Integration with Investigation Pipeline

In `findings.json`, add social media evidence using the standard source schema with `type: "social_media"`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://x.com/username/status/12345",
  "type": "social_media",
  "platform": "X",
  "author": "username",
  "accessed": "2026-03-15T14:20:00Z",
  "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20260315142200/https://x.com/...",
  "access_method": "full_text",
  "authenticity_flags": ["account created 2026-02-01", "high posting volume"],
  "coordination_signals": []
}
```

Flag findings that rest on socially amplified claims: note in `confidence_rationale` whether the account shows authenticity red flags or is part of a suspected coordination cluster.
