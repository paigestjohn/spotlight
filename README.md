# Spotlight

Runtime-agnostic OSINT investigation system for journalists. Verified findings, independent fact-checking, knowledge vault ingestion — driven by any agent harness that can read `AGENTS.md` and dispatch 13 abstract verbs.

## Install (for journalists)

**Open [`setup.html`](setup.html) in any browser.** Pick your runtime, paste your Firecrawl and OSINT Navigator API keys, optionally select integrations (browser-use, Junkipedia, Unpaywall), and click Generate. You'll get two install options:

- **Copy into Terminal** (simplest) — click Copy, ⌘+Space → Terminal → ⌘+V → Return
- **Download installer** — `spotlight-setup.zip` → extract → double-click the `.command` file (macOS Gatekeeper first-time: right-click → Open → Confirm)

The generated installer handles everything: clones this repo, installs `firecrawl-cli` and QMD, installs your chosen runtime, sets up the local model (if Local selected), writes `.env` with your keys (chmod 600), creates the vault scaffold, registers the vault for local search, and runs preflight. Works on macOS and Linux; Windows requires WSL.

The separate **Download agent setup** ZIP contains the same local setup choices and API key values in a private manifest. It is meant for a local agent to perform the same installation without asking you to paste secrets into chat. Keep it private like the command installer.

The installer creates:

- `spotlight` — launch the selected runtime from the Spotlight repo
- `spotlight doctor` — verify install, env names, runtime, vault, QMD, and preflight
- `spotlight update` — fetch `origin main`, fast-forward only, then run doctor

See [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md) for the full setup flow and what happens behind the scenes.

## What this is

An **agnostic port** of the `buriedsignals/spotlight@1.2.1` and `buriedsignals/osint@3.5.0` Claude Code plugins into a runtime-neutral form. The original plugins stay at `~/buried_signals/tools/skills/{spotlight,osint}/` as the canonical reference. This repo is the base that plugs into everything else.

## Supported runtimes

| Runtime | Status | How it loads |
|---|---|---|
| **opencode** (https://opencode.ai) | Primary local — native support | `brew install opencode` (CLI) or `brew install --cask opencode-desktop` (GUI). 11-symlink loop into `~/.config/opencode/skills/`. `AGENTS.md`, sub-agents, MCP all native. Pair with `llama.cpp` provider for fully-local Qwen via llama-server. |
| **Claude Code** | Install package | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`; runs from repo dir |
| **Codex CLI** | Install package | `npm install -g @openai/codex`; reads `AGENTS.md` natively |
| **Gemini CLI** | Install package | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`; symlink `GEMINI.md → AGENTS.md` |
| **Hermes** (Mycroft / Mac Mini) | Production | `skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` |
| **Goose** | Extension pack | `goose extensions install spotlight` |
| **pi** (https://pi.dev) | Local — single-context fallback | `mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/skills && ln -sfn /path/to/spotlight/skills ~/.pi/agent/skills/spotlight`. No native sub-agents, so investigator/fact-checker run in the main session. Use opencode for the full pipeline. |

Per-runtime wiring: **[docs/runtimes.md](docs/runtimes.md)**.

## What you get

- **Investigation pipeline**: Preflight → Brief → Methodology → 5 Execution cycles → Gate 1 → Ingestion
- **Independent fact-checking**: fact-checker spawned per cycle, SIFT methodology, 4-verdict taxonomy
- **6 readiness criteria**: enforced before Gate 1 — min findings, source independence, no unresolved disputes, affected perspective, document trail, gap assessment
- **Evidence grounding**: scrape-before-cite, every source has a `local_file`, archive hierarchy Wayback → Archive.today → local
- **11 skills**: orchestrator (spotlight), review (post-Gate-1 HTML feedback loop), integrations (routing), ingest, monitoring, web-archiving, content-access, osint, investigate, follow-the-money, social-media-intelligence
- **4 external integrations shipped**: browser-use (AI browser automation), Junkipedia (narrative tracking), OSINT Navigator (tool discovery), Unpaywall (academic open access). Framework accepts more — see [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md).
- **Monitoring orchestration**: passive signals from Mycroft plus durable monitors from Scoutpost or runtime-native routines
- **Knowledge vault ingestion**: Markdown vaults for Obsidian or Tolaria, with directory fallback; atomic registry updates; lock-file concurrency
- **Sensitive mode**: strips `fetch`/`search` from agents; investigation runs local-only
- **opencode-native + Hermes-native**: zero adapter code needed for these runtimes; markdown-only contract for others

## Dependencies

Required:
- **firecrawl** CLI — the universal backing for `fetch`/`search`. `npm install -g firecrawl-cli`; set `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`. (Handled automatically by setup.html's generated installer.)

Also installed by setup:
- **qmd** — required for `query-vault` and vault memory. `BUN_INSTALL="" qmd query`.

Optional:
- **obsidian** CLI — for `vault-write` into an Obsidian vault.
- **Tolaria** — optional Markdown/YAML vault app; setup.html can download the latest macOS release when selected.
- **Python 3.11+** — for integrations preflight and optional local helper scripts.
- **Mycroft source-specific keys** — only if you also use Mycroft passive monitoring; for example `ACLED_API_KEY` + `ACLED_EMAIL` for ACLED in Mycroft.
- **OSINT_NAV_API_KEY** — for expanded OSINT tool discovery via OSINT Navigator.
- **JUNKIPEDIA_API_KEY** — for narrative / misinformation tracking (application-based at junkipedia.org).
- **CORE_API_KEY** — for academic paper access in `content-access` skill.
- **Inference backend (for Local runtime)** — `brew install llama.cpp` (lean, what setup.html defaults to) or `brew install ollama` (CLI-first model manager).

## Source reference

- `~/buried_signals/tools/skills/osint@3.5.0/` — original OSINT Claude Code plugin

Content in `skills/` is a verbatim port of these plugins with Claude-specific syntax (`Agent()`, `Skill()`, `WebFetch`, `Bash`, etc.) genericized to the 13 abstract verbs. Semantic invariants (readiness criteria, verdict taxonomy, SIFT, evidence grounding, gate sequencing) are preserved exactly.
