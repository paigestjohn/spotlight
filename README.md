# Spotlight

Spotlight turns an investigation lead into a structured case file: scoped brief,
approved methodology, sourced findings, independent fact-checking, review
artifacts, provenance records, and handoff-ready knowledge.

It is built for active OSINT casework. Give it a lead, URL, document, entity, or
question; it creates a working case directory, gathers source material, tests
claims against evidence, and stops at editorial gates instead of quietly
treating unfinished leads as publishable facts. The active case workspace is
separate from the knowledge vault: Spotlight queries the vault for prior context
when a case starts, and ingests verified material into the vault only after an
explicit end-of-case decision.

## What Spotlight Does

- Builds an investigation brief with the journalist before research starts.
- Drafts a methodology and waits for approval before execution.
- Runs bounded research cycles against public sources, local case files, and the
  journalist's vault.
- Saves source material into the case directory before citing it.
- Produces structured findings with source URLs, local files, confidence,
  evidence grounding, limitations, and monitoring recommendations.
- Runs an independent fact-check pass using SIFT-style source verification.
- Enforces readiness criteria before Gate 1 review.
- Produces review, summary, evidence, and provenance artifacts that can be
  inspected, exported, or ingested into a knowledge vault.

## Investigation Workflow

```text
Preflight
  -> Brief
  -> Methodology
  -> Research and fact-check cycles
  -> Gate 1 review
  -> Ingest, monitor, export, or continue
```

Every gate is explicit. Spotlight does not auto-advance through brief approval,
methodology approval, Gate 1 review, or vault ingestion.

The research loop runs up to five cycles by default:

1. The investigator follows the approved methodology and writes findings.
2. The fact-checker independently checks the findings and writes verdicts.
3. The orchestrator checks source grounding, disputes, gaps, and readiness.
4. If the case is not ready, the next cycle targets the specific gaps.
5. If the case stalls, Spotlight asks the journalist whether to continue, pivot,
   or review the current material as-is.

See [docs/investigating.md](docs/investigating.md) for the full phase and gate
contract.

## Readiness Criteria

Spotlight only opens Gate 1 when the case has passed six editorial checks:

- Enough high-confidence findings.
- Independent source support for key claims.
- No unresolved disputed claims without a resolution path.
- At least one affected or non-official perspective when relevant.
- A document trail with primary sources, not only news coverage.
- Known gaps either resolved or stated as limitations.

These checks are not a truth guarantee. They are a forcing function that keeps
the case file honest about what is known, what is unsupported, and what still
needs reporting.

## Case Outputs

Each investigation gets an isolated working directory under the configured
`SPOTLIGHT_CASES_ROOT` active case workspace:

```text
{CASE_DIR}/
├── brief-directions.txt
├── summary.md
├── review.html
├── data/
│   ├── methodology.json
│   ├── findings.json
│   ├── fact-check.json
│   ├── evidence-bundle.json
│   ├── investigation-log.json
│   ├── summary.json
│   ├── provenance-manifest.json
│   └── monitoring.json
├── research/
│   ├── *.md
│   ├── *.json
│   └── archived/
└── evidence/
    ├── *.png
    └── *.pdf
```

The JSON files validate against schemas in [schemas/](schemas/). The markdown
and HTML files are for human review. The evidence and research folders preserve
the local trail behind the claims.

## Source Acquisition

Spotlight's default source path is simple:

1. Search and scrape with Firecrawl.
2. Save the source artifact locally.
3. Archive or capture the source when preservation matters.
4. Cite only material that can be traced back to a local file.

Use `dev-browser` only for specific investigative tasks that require browser
automation: dynamic pages, search forms, authenticated portals, rendered tables,
downloads, visual evidence, or multi-step UI navigation. Firecrawl remains the
first acquisition path for ordinary search and scrape work.

## Integrations

Spotlight is runtime-agnostic, but investigations need specialized tools. The
important integrations are:

| Integration | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Firecrawl | Search and scrape public web sources into local case files. |
| dev-browser | Interactive or headless browser acquisition with screenshots, HTML, metadata, hashes, and journalist-controlled authentication. |
| OSINT Navigator | Tool discovery and method routing when the built-in catalog is not enough. |
| Scoutpost | Durable monitoring for leads, sources, and follow-up developments. |
| Mycroft | Passive signals, vault memory, and handoff into durable newsroom knowledge. |
| Junkipedia | Narrative and misinformation tracking when the newsroom has access. |
| Unpaywall | Legal open-access lookup for academic papers. |
| Noosphere C2PA | Optional provenance signing for case-level packages. |

See [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md) for setup and routing details.

## Install

Open [setup.html](setup.html) in a browser. Choose a runtime, enter the keys you
want to use, select optional integrations, and generate an installer.

The installer:

- clones the Spotlight source,
- installs required command-line dependencies,
- writes local environment/config files,
- creates the active case workspace and knowledge-vault scaffold,
- registers the vault for local search,
- installs `spotlight`, `spotlight doctor`, and `spotlight update`,
- runs preflight.

Two install paths are generated:

- **Copy into Terminal**: paste the generated script into a terminal.
- **Download installer**: extract the ZIP and run the `.command` file on macOS.

The setup page runs locally in the browser. API keys in the form are used to
generate local install artifacts; they are not submitted to a server.

## Runtimes

Spotlight can run under any agent harness that can read `AGENTS.md`, load the
skills, and bind the abstract operations to real tools. Current runtime paths
include opencode, pi, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Hermes/Mycroft, and
Goose.

Per-runtime wiring lives in [docs/runtimes.md](docs/runtimes.md). The
machine-readable contract lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Local Models

Local model selection is an implementation detail, not the product. Spotlight
can use cloud, ZDR, or local inference depending on the runtime and newsroom
policy. Runtime docs should carry model notes and fit checks.
